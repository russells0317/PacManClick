# PacManClick
Description: This was an assignment that required students to move a PacMan character across the screen.
Installation: Download all the files into the same location and then upload the .html file to your browser. Continuously click on the PacMan character to watch it move across the screen.
Roadmap: There is potential for this project to be updated featuring the PacMan ghosts and the chasing (similar to the game) of the ghosts.
